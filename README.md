# KleineOS kernel

My experimentation ground

## TODO
- [ ] unit tests for PCIe Manager

## Goals of the project

1. A simple FAT driver for filesystem access
2. Userspace with a basic shell
3. Multiprocessing, and a demo to showcase it

### Measurable goals

1. A Gemini (protocol not AI) server
2. A Gemini (protocol not AI) client
3. (if I can pull it off) a mechanism to reload the kernel without reloading the userspace
